## 💡 **Usage Examples**

### **Specialized Financial Analysis**
```python
from src.agents.file_explorer import create_agent_by_key

# Risk assessment with pattern-based analysis
risk_agent = create_agent_by_key('fintech_risk_analyst')
memory = risk_agent.run("Analyze financial risk patterns in this codebase")

# Compliance audit with hybrid AI insights
compliance_agent = create_agent_by_key('fintech_compliance_hybrid')
memory = compliance_agent.run("Perform comprehensive regulatory compliance review")

# Performance optimization for HFT systems
performance_agent = create_agent_by_key('fintech_performance_analyst')
memory = performance_agent.run("Evaluate high-frequency trading performance patterns")
```

### **Cost-Optimized LLM Usage**
```python
from src.framework.llm.client import LLMClient

client = LLMClient()

# Fast, cost-effective analysis
response = client.generate_response(prompt, model_type='fast')      # Up to 10x cheaper

# Balanced performance for most tasks  
response = client.generate_response(prompt, model_type='default')   # 3-5x cheaper

# Premium quality for critical decisions
response = client.generate_response(prompt, model_type='advanced')  # Highest quality
```

## 🙏 **Attribution & Learning Journey**

This project evolved from foundational concepts introduced in the Vanderbilt University/Coursera course "AI Agents and Agentic AI with Python & Generative AI", which taught me the GAME framework pattern.

Building upon these educational foundations, I developed this comprehensive multi-agent FinTech analysis platform, integrating my 15+ years of Financial Technology and Wealth Management experience to create production-ready solutions addressing real industry challenges in risk management, regulatory compliance, and system performance optimization.
