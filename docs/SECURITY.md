# Security Policy

## üîí Security Features

This FinTech AI Agent Framework implements enterprise-grade security practices suitable for financial services deployment.

### API Key Management
- **Environment Variables Only**: All API keys stored in environment variables
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Zero hardcoded credentials in source code
- **Secure Validation**: API key validation without exposure in logs
- **Provider Isolation**: Each provider's credentials isolated

### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: All file paths and inputs validated
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Project root detection prevents directory traversal
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information never exposed in error messages
- **Audit Trails**: All analysis operations logged for compliance

### Pattern Detection Security
- **No Code Execution**: Analysis uses pattern matching only, never executes analyzed code
- **Read-Only Operations**: Framework only reads files, never modifies
- **Sandboxed Analysis**: File operations restricted to project boundaries
- **Memory Safety**: Efficient processing prevents memory exhaustion

### Compliance Features
- **SOX Ready**: Audit logging and access control patterns
- **GDPR Compliant**: PII detection and data protection validation
- **PCI-DSS Support**: Security scanning for payment card data

## üö® Reporting Security Issues

While this is a portfolio project, security is taken seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do Not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Contact via LinkedIn: [Arthur Ball](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-ball-bb41327/)
3. Provide details of the vulnerability
4. Allow time for assessment and fix

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Deployment
1. **API Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate all LLM provider API keys
2. **Access Control**: Implement RBAC for multi-user deployments
3. **Network Security**: Deploy behind firewalls with restricted access
4. **Monitoring**: Enable comprehensive logging and alerting
5. **Encryption**: Use TLS for all network communications

### For Development
1. **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update all dependencies
2. **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code review process
3. **Testing**: Security test cases for all new features
4. **Documentation**: Clear security documentation for all components

## üìã Security Checklist
